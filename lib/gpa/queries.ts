/**
 * GPA SQL aggregation queries.
 *
 * Both functions push all arithmetic into PostgreSQL.
 * JavaScript sees only one or a handful of pre-aggregated rows —
 * never the raw grade rows.
 *
 * ─── Why SUM(computed_quality_points) and not SUM(grade_point × credit_hours)?
 *
 * computed_quality_points is written at grade-entry time and already holds
 * gradePoint × creditHours. Reading it is O(1) per row with no arithmetic.
 * Computing gradePoint × creditHours at query time forces the DB to cast
 * two numeric columns, multiply, and discard the result on every read.
 * At 10 k rows it is immeasurable; at 1 M rows it is not.
 *
 * ─── Credits earned vs credits attempted
 *
 * attempted = all scoring credit hours (including F grades)
 * earned    = scoring credit hours where grade != 'F'
 *
 * Both are computed in a single pass using CASE WHEN inside SUM —
 * no second query, no subquery, no application-level filtering.
 *
 * ─── Non-scoring courses
 *
 * Excluded via INNER JOIN courses + WHERE courses.is_scoring = true.
 * They appear on the transcript (fetched separately) but never enter
 * the quality-points or credit-hours aggregates.
